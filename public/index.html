                      <p>“Chris Loper has been an enormous part of the growth of my business over the last two years.  Chris is an outstanding academic coach, but he has offered so much more to my business than his coaching skills.  Chris is an excellent writer.  In addition to writing our blog and in-office literature, he does the bulk of editing and copy-writing for my business.  Chris has also helped me to both clarify and reach my business goals.  For example, I had long wanted to teach some small classes during the summer, and Chris pushed me to launch this program, clarify the content of the classes, include additional classes, and advertise them effectively.

                      Chris Loper has also offered a wide variety of creative contributions to my business, such as how to use our office space more effectively, new ways to market the business, additional services to sell our existing clients, and the implementation of time-saving processes such as FAQs and mass-emailing.  Lastly, with his psychology background, he is a constant source of ideas for how we can improve our one-on-one work with clients.”

                      <p>“I began working with Chris after a year into starting my career
                        in real estate.  It was a complete game changer.  With real estate
                         being a largely self-motivation based business and after years of
                         working in the service industry where I always had a clear plan and
                         defined goals, I was having some trouble consistently engaging and
                         reinforcing the right habits to see success.  Chris has helped me
                         turn that around with a number of strategies and practices to help
                         me not just now, or just with one area of my life, but in any area
                         of concern by establishing quality habits and a positive, productive
                         mindset.  I can’t speak highly enough of the value in having spent
                         my time working with Chris.”</p>
