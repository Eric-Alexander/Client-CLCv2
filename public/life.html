                      Are you struggling to implement the advice of your doctor or therapist? Having difficulty getting yourself to do the homework assigned by your physical or occupational therapist?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I've been there. I figured out and got myself to do the work to regain my health. I will coach you on how to do the things you know you're supposed to do. My coaching makes an excellent supplement to these traditional healthcare services.

                    <p>
                      I've been there, too. I teach proven strategies that are backed by scientific research as well as my own experience. I'll also make sure you're approaching this change effort with helpful mindsets rather than the counterproductive attitudes that are, unfortunately, all-too-common.
